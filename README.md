### My name is Utkarsh Vardhan

I am currently working at [Curl Tech ](https://curl.tech/)

I am currently learning

1. Applying Computer Vision and NLP based techniques for Document Extraction.
2. Deploying and monitoring Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models in Production setup.



My earlier work in Production Setup:

1.  Tree based model for MultiClass and MutliLabel Classification of Business Documents. 
2. Document Representation and Clustering System using Representation Learning.
3. Named Entity Recognition System for identifying different entities in the Business Documents. 
4. Text Detection System using Object Detection to identify different regions (Table,Paragraphs,Logo,Seal etc) in the Business Documents.
5. Entity Relation Extraction from Documents containing paragraphs to identify different entities and the relationship between entities.
6. Using Transformer based architectures for End to End Document Extraction in the following settings:
   1. Question Answering Task
   2. Key Value Pair Extraction 
   3. Entity Extraction

7. Deployment of Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL) models using Docker Containers.
8. Integrate log aggregation system using Loki and Granfana for ML/DL docker containers.
9. Integrate Machine Learning models  input logs using Kibana.
10. Integrating Prometheus and Grafana as monitoring platform for ML/DL docker containers.
